# puppet-apt_cacher_ng

A Puppet module for [apt-cacher-ng], with a `Vagrantfile` for quick
deployment on [Vagrant].

Requires puppetlabs [stdlib] module

Original author: [Alban Peignier]

* [Lekensteyn]: auto-detect/fallback script (see [askubuntu:54099])

## Installation in Production

* Clone the module into your `/etc/puppet/modules` directory:

        cd /etc/puppet/modules
        git clone git://github.com/lelutin/puppet-apt_cacher_ng apt_cacher_ng

* Install stdlib dependency (if not already present):
        
        cd /etc/puppet/modules
        git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib.git stdlib

* Edit the definition for your server to include `apt_cacher_ng`, perhaps
  specifying `version`:

    ```puppet
    class { 'apt_cacher_ng':
      version => '0.4.6-1ubuntu1',
    }
    ```

    The server will be available at the default port (3142).

    The server will not use itself as a cache by default.

* Edit the definition for your clients to include `apt_cacher_ng::client`:

    ```puppet
    class { 'apt_cacher_ng::client':
      server  => "192.168.31.42:3142",
    }
    ```

* To specify more than one server:

    ```puppet
    class { 'apt_cacher_ng::client':
      servers => ["192.168.30.42:3142", "192.168.31.42:3142"],
    }
    ```

* To override proxy connection timeout:

    ```puppet
    class { 'apt_cacher_ng::client':
      server  => "192.168.31.42:3142",
      timeout => 15,
    }
    ```

* To disable fallback to direct access if the proxy is not available:

    ```puppet
    class { 'apt_cacher_ng::client':
      autodetect => false,
      server     => "192.168.31.42:3142",
    }
    ```

    Per [askubuntu:54099], you'll need to do this on older Ubuntu and Debian
    releases. Lucid and Squeeze support `Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect`;
    Karmic and Lenny don't.

## Providing an apt cache for your Vagrant virtual machines

To install apt-cacher-ng on a fresh box in [Vagrant]:

    vagrant up aptcache

The `Vagrantfile` specifies a box named `aptcache` providing its service
from `http://192.168.31.42:3142`. You should be able to browse to it from
your host OS to manage it.

### Using the apt cache

To configure your own Vagrant box to access the `aptcache` box:

* Configure your VM for [host-only networking], by adding the following line
  to your `Vagrantfile`:

        config.vm.network :hostonly, "192.168.31.2"

    (Change the final octet (`2`) to make sure it's unique on your machine. 
    Don't use `1`: it'll probably be used by your host OS for its `vboxnet0`
    adapter.)

* Inside your box, create `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/71proxy` with the line:

        Acquire::http { Proxy "http://192.168.31.42:3142"; };

    If you're using [Puppet Provisioning], put this in your `manifest_file`, 
    e.g. `my_manifest.pp`:

        file { "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/71proxy": 
          owner   => root,
          group   => root,
          mode    => '0644',
          content => 'Acquire::http { Proxy "http://192.168.31.42:3142"; };',
        }

    You could also install the Puppet module and use `apt_cacher_ng::client`
    as above.

## Testing

To perform a [smoke test]: 

    make smoke

To smoke test both the module and the `Vagrantfile`'s `manifest_file`:

    make test

To test the module properly, install [Vagrant] and:

    make vm
